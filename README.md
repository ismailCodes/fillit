FILLIT project

Fillit is a project that let me discover and/or familiarize myself with a recurring problematic in programming:
  searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable timing.
In this particular project, I had to find a way to assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square.
